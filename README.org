* memacs
This is *me* macs, not /you/ macs.

This config exists because:
- I want Doom-level ergonomics without Doom’s framework

** Design goals
- Doom-like UX, but assembled manually
- Works inside a **sandboxed HOME** (memacs runs with its own `$HOME`)
- [[file:.emacs.d/config/m-core.el]] defines where your real home is, you will want to change it from my username
- On nix you can create a wrapper around this to isolate its home without needing to lock the config into your store.
